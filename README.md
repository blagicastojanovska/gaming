## Environment setup
You will need to have `NodeJS` setup on your pc. Follow the instructions on https://nodejs.org/en/ for installation.

When you are done just type `node -v` in your command line to see if `NodeJS` was installed. It is preferred to use the `LTS`
version.

You can use whatever you want as package manager. Preferred are `npm` that comes with `NodeJS` or `yarn` that you can install from https://yarnpkg.com/en/.

## Code Process
Once in the main folder, install the server dependencies with the command `npm install` or `yarn` depending on your package manager.

Start the server with the command `npm start` or `yarn start`.

Once you enter the start command, you should see this message:
